# Somerville Traffic Crash Analysis and Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting traffic crashes in Somerville using machine learning techniques. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset of traffic incidents, we aim to uncover patterns, identify risk factors, and develop predictive models to enhance road safety.

## Project Goals

1. **Analyze Contributing Factors**: Investigate and quantify the various elements that contribute to traffic crashes in Somerville.

2. **Crash Severity Prediction**: Develop machine learning models to predict the severity of crashes based on environmental, temporal, and spatial features.

3. **High-Risk Location Identification**: Use data analysis and visualization techniques to pinpoint areas and times with elevated crash risks.
